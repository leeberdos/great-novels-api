# Great Novels UI

## Instructions
In the initial commit of this project you have been provided with a fully functional REST API for retrieving data about great novels. Your task is to add a React front end to this project that will display a list of novels and include a search box allowing the user to search for particular novels by title. Your solution should be a true mono-repo with the react in a `client` folder created with create-react-app.

## Requirements
- React code in a `client` folder, created with create-react-app.
- Express code stays in the root folder.
- Express server must be setup to serve the build folder.
- npm run dev should start create-react-app and the Express server.
- The data should only be fetched from the API once per page load.
- The novels must be listed with their name and the author's full name.
